The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (often shortened to TMNT or Ninja Turtles) are a
fictional team of four teenage anthropomorphic turtles, named after four Renaissance
artists, who were trained by their anthropomorphic rat sensei in the art of ninjutsu. From
their home in the storm sewers of New York City, they battle petty criminals, evil
overlords, mutated animals, and alien invaders while attempting to remain hidden from
society. They were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.

The characters originated in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book before their
expansion into a cartoon series, films, video games, toys, and other general
merchandise.[2] During the peak of the franchise's popularity in the late 1980s and early
1990s, it gained considerable worldwide success and fame
