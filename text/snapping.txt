The common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is a large freshwater turtle of the
family Chelydridae. Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the
edge of the Rocky Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. This species and the
larger alligator snapping turtle are the only two species in this family found in North
America (though the common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is much more
widespread).[2] The common snapping turtle is noted for its belligerent disposition when
out of the water, its powerful beak-like jaws, and highly mobile head and neck (hence the
specific name serpentina, meaning "snake-like"). In some areas, they are hunted very
heavily for their meat, a popular ingredient in turtle soup. Snapping turtles have a
life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and
hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, and iteroparity (repeated
reproductive events) with low reproductive success per reproductive event. Females, and
presumably also males, in more northern populations mature later (at 15-20 years) and at a
larger size than in more southern populations (about 12 years). Lifespan in the wild is
poorly known, but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada
suggest a maximum age over 100 years.
